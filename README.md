# Introductory Exercise

This repository contains solutions to three JavaScript exercises:

## Exercise 1: Logical Division Check
Write a program that defines a number and checks the following:
- Print `1` if the number is divisible by 2, 3, or 5 (only one divisor).
- Print `2` if divisible by exactly two of them (for example, 2 and 3).
- Print `3` if divisible by all three (2, 3, and 5).

**Restrictions:**
- Do not use `if` or control structures.
- Use logical operators and convert Boolean results to numbers with `Number()`.

## Exercise 2: Prime Numbers
Write code to print all prime numbers less than 237 using loops and logical operators.

## Exercise 3: Count Zeros in an Array
Write a program that defines an array of integers and calculates the number of zeros using a conditional expression (no `if` statements).



> Exercises 1, 2, and 3 are included in a folder named "IntroductoryExercise".
